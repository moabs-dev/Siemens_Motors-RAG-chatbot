üß© What‚Äôs really happening

1) FastAPI runs in a single Python process (unless you explicitly restart or spawn workers).

--That process loads .env once at startup.

--The variables inside .env are copied into os.environ.

2) When you create ChatGroq(...) inside your get_chain():

--It looks up os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] at that moment.

--If the wrong key is in memory, the Groq client fails with 401 ‚Üí your chain is effectively broken.

3) Changing the .env file later (after startup):

--Does not automatically refresh os.environ for the running process.

--Unless you explicitly call load_dotenv(override=True) and rebuild the ChatGroq object with the new key, FastAPI will keep using the stale key it already had.

Different angle :

1) When you gave a wrong API key

--ChatGroq tried to make a request.

--Groq‚Äôs SDK threw an exception (AuthenticationError or APIConnectionError).

--Since there was no try/except in your /chat endpoint, the error bubbled up ‚Üí FastAPI auto-converted it to a 500 Internal Server Error.

--At this point, your FastAPI server was still running (unless the exception wasn‚Äôt handled in the worker). But Streamlit only saw ‚Äú500 Internal Server Error.‚Äù

2) When you then gave a correct key (via /set_key)

--You updated .env and os.environ. ‚úÖ

--BUT: the qa_chain (and the llm inside it) was already instantiated earlier with the old key.

--LangChain doesn‚Äôt magically reload that chain just because os.environ changed.

--So when you hit /chat again, it was still trying to talk to Groq using the old bad key.

3) Result ‚Üí still error, even though you gave the right key.

--Why Swagger seemed fine

--Swagger calls were fresh when you restarted FastAPI, meaning qa_chain was re-built with the latest key at app startup.

--That‚Äôs why Swagger worked while Streamlit (which was running continuously) kept hitting the stale chain.
